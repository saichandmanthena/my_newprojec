Hi im saichand ,
As per ur requirement DevOps_Fresher_Test  was solved 
Now I am explaning step by step process ,

1) create one aws free tier account

2) login to aws console  and create one ubuntu 16.04 server

3) connect the above server by using putty 

4) install terraform  and ansible to the above ubuntu server (as per ur requirement i use
 terraform for two ububtu severs creations and
 ansible for install packages )

5) In that server , I wrote terraform scripts for 2 ububtu 16.04 servers... named as         
      
        main.tf
              
        test1.tf
              
        variable.tf

6) Now execute the terraform scripts by
 following commands
            
       i)  terraform init
          
       ii) terraform plan
            
       iii) teraform apply
 
7) Two ubuntu 16.04 servers were created 

 8) Installed packages in two Ubuntu servers by
 using playbook , u will get the files below
  named as 
       
     i) hosts (contains ip address of above 2
 servers)

packages)
